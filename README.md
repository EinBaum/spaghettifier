# Spaghettifier
Breaks and uglifies code.

## About

### How it works
It does two things, replaces all semi-colons ```;``` with greek question marks ```Í¾```, and removes all indenting.

### Why??
Because I have a talent for turning things into spaghetti, felt the need to automate some of the process, and was somewhat inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson/status/533848879423578112).

### Why would anybody want to use this?
I don't know, some people are weird, and some people like annoying their friends. This is aimed at weird people who like annoying their friends.

### How can you sleep knowing this is being used to ruin people's lives?
Comfortably.

### TODO
- Improve design
- Add more spaghettification methods
- Add more info and stuff to site
