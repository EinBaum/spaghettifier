# Spaghettifier
Breaks and uglifies code.

## How to use
Simply paste code to spaghetti inside of the textbox, then click "spaghetti". There will be no visible changes, but it probably won't work anymore.

## About

### How it works
Simply replaces all semi-colons ```;``` with greek question marks ```;```, they look identical yet for obvious reasons, greek question marks will not function as semicolons.

I am also in the process of adding more character replacements, I have recently made ```o``` be replaced with ```о```

### Why??
Because I have a talent for turning things into spaghetti, felt the need to automate some of the process, and was somewhat inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson/status/533848879423578112).

### Why would anybody want to use this?
I don't know, some people are weird, and some people like annoying their friends. This is aimed at weird people who like annoying their friends.

### How can you sleep knowing this is being used to ruin people's lives?
Comfortably.

### TODO
- Improve design
- Add more spaghettification methods
- Add more info and stuff to site
