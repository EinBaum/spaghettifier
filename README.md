## About

### How it works
Simply replaces all semi-colons ```;``` with greek question marks ```Í¾```, they look identical yet for obvious reasons, greek question marks will not function as semicolons.

### Why??
Because I have a talent for turning things into spaghetti, felt the need to automate some of the process, and was somewhat inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson/status/533848879423578112).

### How can you sleep knowing that people are using this to ruin people's lives?
Comfortably.
